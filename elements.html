									<p>In this project, we are using gestures(by extracting the key points from the library), setting conditions based on the gestures that the code reads and sending data to arduino to turn the LEDs on/off. <br>

									The gesture 1 lets you turn on LED-1, 2 for LED- 2, 3 for LED-3, 5 for turning all the LEDs off and 0 for exiting.</p>

									<h3>OpenCV</h2>
									<p>OpenCV (Open-Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in commercial products.</p>
									
									<hr>
									<h3>Google text to speech </h2>
									<p>In short, in the "Awaaz" project, gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) is used to convert customizable text messages into spoken words. When the system detects a gesture representing a number (1 to 5), it generates a text message based on that gesture. This text message is then converted into speech using gTTS and played out loud, providing a means of communication for paralyzed or differently-abled individuals in hospitals or care centers.</p>
									
									<hr>
									<h3>CVZone</h2>
									<p>Cvzone is the library that develops a bridge between Arduino and python. With the help of the SerialObject module in Cvzone we can connect the arduino port with python as well as send data to arduino and can link any python code with it.</p>

									<hr>

									<h2>SDGs we tackle</h2>
									<p>Awaaz tackles three key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations. It directly contributes to Good Health and Well-being (SDG 3) by improving communication for people with disabilities, potentially leading to better healthcare access.  
										Furthermore, Awaaz promotes Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10) by empowering these individuals and fostering a more inclusive society.  Finally, the development of Awaaz itself exemplifies Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17),  highlighting the importance of 
										collaboration in achieving these global objectives.</p>

									<hr>

									<h2>Goals for the Future</h2>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Expanded Gesture Recognition: </b>Recognizing more complex gestures for a wider range of expressions.										</li>
										<li><b>Integration with Smart Home Devices: </b>Allowing control of room functions like lights or TV.</li>
										<li><b>Data Collection:</b>Gathering data on gestures for research or improving the model's accuracy.</li>
									</ul>
